# Monitoring_land_restoration

This repository contains all the scripts developed for the article: **A Remote Sensing Assessment of Farmer-Managed Land Restoration in Seven African Countries using Dense NDVI Time Series Forecasting**. The scripts are numbered (A1, A2, etc) based on the order in which they should be executed.

The restoration polygon data is not made available for privacy and property reasons. Still, parts of the analysis can be reproduced as some intermediate Landsat 8 time series have been made available here. The data provided in the folder `output/time_series` and `output/plot_data` can be used to run the analysis from the script _'A6-ts_analysis.qmd'_ onwards.
