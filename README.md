# Monitoring_land_restoration

Scripts to monitor the Regreening Africa project in eight different countries.

This repository contains all the scripts developed for the article: **A Remote Sensing Assessment of Farmer-Managed Land Restoration in Seven African Countries using Dense NDVI Time Series Forecasting**.

The restoration polygon data is not available for privacy and property reasons. Still, some intermediate datasets can be downloaded here, so parts of the analysis can be replicated.
